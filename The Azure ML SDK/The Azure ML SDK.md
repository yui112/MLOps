# The Azure ML SDK



**Azure ML Software Development Kit (SDK)** is especially useful to us because it essentially connects two other incredibly useful tools:

- The **Azure ML platform**, which gives us the ability to easily **automate** our machine learning pipelines.
- The **Python ecosystem**, which has a rich open source library and allows you to greatly **customize** your applications.

The SDK allows you to combine the *automation* of the Azure ML platform with the *customizability* of the Python ecosystem to greatly increase the effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility of your ML applications. Because the SDK is Python-based, it allows us to tap into a rich ecosystem and build a huge variety of tools, from web applications to command-line tools.



## Azure ML Key Capabilities

- **Dataset lifecycle.** You can use the SDK to manage your dataset lifecycle. This includes organizing, monitoring, and logging your ML experiments and resources.
- **Train models.** The SDK can be used to train a model, either locally or with cloud resources (e.g., to do GPU-accelerated model training).
- **AutoML.** Using the SDK, you can leverage the power of the cloud platform to automatically iterate through algorithms and hyper parameter tunings to find the best model for running predictions.
- **Web services.** Finally, you can deploy your web service easily by converting your trained model into a RESTful service that can be consumed by any application.



## Azure ML Modes

- **Stable.** The *stable* mode uses an established version to ensure you have a stable environment that you can count on. This is recommended for most use cases.
- **Experimental.** If you're an early adopter, you can use *experimental* mode, which is for advanced users who want to try out new features as they become available and are comfortable tolerating some potential bugs.
